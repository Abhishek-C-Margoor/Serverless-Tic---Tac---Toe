🎮 Two-Player Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This is a complete, browser-based Tic-Tac-Toe (Noughts and Crosses) game designed for two players sharing a single device. The project is built entirely on client-side code, making it highly efficient and easy to deploy as a static website.

✨ Features
Local Two-Player Gameplay: Players alternate turns as 'X' and 'O'.

Custom Player Names: Users can input and change names for Player X and Player O.

Intuitive Controls: Includes a Restart Game button to clear the board and a Back to Setup button to return to the name entry screen.

Clear Status: Features a dynamic turn indicator and displays a message for the winner or a draw.

Optimized for Static Hosting: Ideal for fast, free deployment on various cloud services.

🚀 Live Demo
The game is currently hosted on Amazon S3 using the static website hosting feature.

💻 Tech Stack
The project relies purely on front-end web technologies:

Technology	Role
HTML5	Provides the structural markup for the game board and interface.
CSS3	Handles all styling, layout, and visual design (including the dark theme).
JavaScript (Vanilla)	Implements the core game logic, state management, and win condition checks.
📂 Project Structure
The project uses a standard, flat file structure:

tic-tac-toe/
│
├── index.html   // Main game structure and UI elements
├── style.css    // All visual styling
└── script.js    // All game logic and DOM manipulation
☁️ Deployment Guide (AWS S3)
The project is hosted using the Amazon S3 Static Website Hosting feature, which falls under the AWS Free Tier.

To deploy your own version, follow these steps:

Create S3 Bucket: Create a new S3 bucket with a unique name.

Permissions: Disable "Block all public access" and apply a Bucket Policy to allow s3:GetObject access for the principal * (everyone).

Upload Files: Upload all three files (index.html, style.css, script.js) to the root of the bucket.

Enable Hosting: In the Properties tab, enable Static Website Hosting and set the Index document to index.html.

Access: Use the generated Bucket website endpoint URL to access the live game.

📝 Next Steps (Potential Enhancements)
Add a simple sound effect for clicks and wins.

Implement a "Play Again?" pop-up after a game ends.

Explore advanced features like online multiplayer using a service like Firebase or AWS Lambda/DynamoDB (This would introduce a backend).
